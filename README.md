## Overview

Second project for front end mentor, struggled quite a bit since I haven't touched html and css for quite a while and I was still familiarizing myself with grids. I learned that if you can't do it today, do it the next. I am actually learning DSA at the moment and totally forgot to touch webdevelopment again. Constantly learn new things everyone! I do hope you learn something from my code ^^.
